# Spryker Support Issue Tracker
This is Spryker's official support desk. You can add a [new support issue here](https://github.com/spryker/support/issues/new). We kindly ask you to write the description of the issue in English and not to assign the issue to anyone.

We are using several categories to structure the issues:

**Bug**

In case you discoverd a functional bug, please provide an issue with all significant information including descriptive summary, steps to reproduce, current behaviour, expected behaviour, the related bundle-name and version. The core team will comment on this issue as soon as possible and give a rough estimation on how/when we will fix it. The issue will stay open until the bug is fixed, and once fixed we will notify you and close the issue. [See all open bugs](https://github.com/spryker/support/labels/Bug)

**Feature request**

You may discover that an important feature is missing in Spryker or that you have an idea for improvement. Please write some notes about what is missing or could be better. The core team will comment it as soon as possible, so you will get an answer if the feature request is taken over into Spryker's backlog. These issues will be closed afterwards. [See all open feature requests](https://github.com/spryker/support/labels/Feature%20request)

**Question** 

For discussing and asking questions, you can use Spryker community forum where we encourage our community members to share ideas and participate in discussions. In our forum we answer questions and help you find solutions to code with Spryker. 
You can ask any question which is related to Spryker's software design. Maybe you need a plan of attack for a new feature or just some information on how to do things, we will be happy to assist. [Visit Spryker forum](http://discuss.spryker.com/).
