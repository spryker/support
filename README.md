# Spryker Support Issue Tracker
This is Spryker's official support desk. You can add a [new support issue here](https://github.com/spryker/support/issues/new). We kindly ask you to write the description of the issue in English and to not assign the issue to somebody.

We are using several labels to structure the issues:

**Question** 

You can ask any question which is related to Spryker's software design. Maybe you need a plan of attack for a new feature or just some information on how to do things. The issue stays open until the question is answered. [See all open questions](https://github.com/spryker/support/labels/Question)

**Bug**

In case you discoverd a functional bug, please provide an issue with all significant information including the related bundle-name and version. The core team will comment this issue as soon as possible and give a rough estimation on how/when we fix it. The issue will stay open until the bug is fixed. [See all open bugs](https://github.com/spryker/support/labels/Bug)

**Feature request**

You may discover that an important feature is missing in Spryker or that you have an idea for improvements. Please write some notes about what is missing or could be better. The core team will comment it as soon as possible, so you will get an answer if the feature request is taken over into Spryker's backlog. These issues will be closed afterwards. [See all open feature requests](https://github.com/spryker/support/labels/Feature%20request)
