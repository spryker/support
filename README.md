# Spryker Support Desk
This is Spryker's official support desk.

You can add a [new support issue here](https://github.com/spryker/support/issues/new). We kindly ask you to write in english language and to not assign the issues to somebody.

We are using several labels to structure the issues:

**Question** 

You can ask any question which is releated to Spryker's software design. Maybe you need a plan of attack for a new feature or just some information how to do things. The issue stays open until the question is answered. 

**Bug**

In case you discoverd a functional bug, please provide an issue with all significant information including the related bundle-name and version. The core team will comment this issue as soon as possible and give a rough estimation how/when we fix it. This issue stays be open until the bug is fixed.

**Feature request**

You may discover that an important feature is missing in Spryker or you have an idea for improvements. Please write some notes about what is missing or could be better. The core team will comment it as soon as possible, so you will get an answer if the feature request is taken over into Spryker's backlog. These issues will be closed afterwards.

**Hook request**

We give our best to make Spryker as open and extensible as possible. But sometimes you may find situations where you need cumbersome workarounds to implement your requirement. For instance if plugins are missing in the "right" place. In this case please add a hook request and we will look at it.
